### Intended use

This model is being created in order to enable public research on large language models (LLMs). LLMs are intended to be used for language generation or as a pretrained base model that can be further fine-tuned for specific tasks. Use cases below are not exhaustive.

#### **Direct Use**

-   Text generation

-   Exploring characteristics of language generated by a language model.

    -   Examples: Cloze tests, counterfactuals, generations with reframings.

#### **Downstream Use**

-   Tasks that leverage language models include: Information Extraction, Question Answering, Summarization.

### Misuse and Out-of-scope Use

*This section addresses what users ought not do with the model.*

See the  [LLM LICENSE ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10NMjEKjxR7mrZ5CvugGBVaF6nPEgNxFBIbkH7z5HB-0/edit), Attachment A, for detailed usage restrictions. The below list is non-exhaustive, but lists some easily foreseeable problematic use cases.

#### **Out-of-scope Uses**

Using the model in [high-stakes](#glossary-and-calculations) settings is out of scope for this model.  The model is not designed for [critical decisions](#glossary-and-calculations) nor uses with any material consequences on an individual's livelihood or wellbeing. The model outputs content that appears factual but is not correct.  

##### Out-of-scope uses include:

-   Usage in biomedical domains, political and legal domains, or finance domains.

-   Usage for evaluating or scoring individuals, such as for employment, education, or credit.

-   Applying the model for critical automatic decisions, generating factual content, creating reliable summaries, or generating predictions that must be correct.

#### **Misuse**

Intentionally using the model for harm, violating rights, or other kinds of malicious activities is a misuse of this model. This includes:

-   Spam generation

-   Disinformation and influence operations

-   Disparagement and defamation

-   Harassment and abuse
  
-   Deception

-   Unconsented impersonation and imitation

-   Unconsented surveillance 


-   Generating content without attribution to the model, as specified in the [RAIL License, Use Restrictions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10NMjEKjxR7mrZ5CvugGBVaF6nPEgNxFBIbkH7z5HB-0/edit#heading=h.3blioxkgzsje).

## Recommendations

*This section provides information on warnings and potential mitigations.*



<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary><br/>

-   Indirect users should be made aware when the content they're working with is created by the LLM.

-   Users should be aware of [Risks and Limitations](#risks-and-limitations), and include an appropriate age disclaimer or blocking interface as necessary.

-   Models pre-trained with the LLM should include an updated Model Card.

-   Users of the model should provide mechanisms for those affected to provide feedback, such as an email address for comments.

</details>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Glossary and Calculations

*This section defines common terms and how metrics are calculated.*



<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary><br/>

-   **Loss:** A calculation of the difference between what the model has learned and what the data shows ("groundtruth"). The lower the loss, the better. The training process aims to minimize the loss. 


-   **Perplexity:** This is based on what the model estimates the probability of new data is. The lower the perplexity, the better.  If the model is 100% correct at predicting the next token it will see, then the perplexity is 1. Mathematically this is calculated using entropy. 

-   **High-stakes settings:** Such as those identified as "high-risk AI systems" and "unacceptable risk AI systems" in the European Union's proposed [Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/annexes/).

-   **Critical decisions**: Such as those defined in [the United States' proposed Algorithmic Accountability Act](https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/s3572/BILLS-117s3572is.pdf).

-   **Human Rights**: Includes those rights defined in the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2021/03/udhr.pdf).

-  **Personal Data and Information**: Personal data and information is defined in multiple data protection regulations, such as "[personal data](https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/personal-data/)" in the [European Union's General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu); and "personal information" in the Republic of South Africa's [Protection of Personal Information Act](https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201409/3706726-11act4of2013popi.pdf), The People's Republic of China's [Personal information protection law](http://en.npc.gov.cn.cdurl.cn/2021-12/29/c_694559.htm).
  
- **Sensitive Characteristics**: This includes specifically protected categories in human rights (see [UHDR, Article 2](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2021/03/udhr.pdf)) and personal information regulation (see GDPR, [Article 9; Protection of Personal Information Act, Chapter 1](https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201409/3706726-11act4of2013popi.pdf))

- **Deception:** Doing something to intentionally mislead individuals to believe something that is false, such as by creating deadbots or chatbots on social media posing as real people, or generating text documents without making consumers aware that the text is machine generated.
