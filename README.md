##### **Direct Use**

-   Text generation

-   Exploring characteristics of language generated by a language model.

    -   Examples: Cloze tests, counterfactuals, generations with reframings.

##### **Downstream Use**

-   Tasks that leverage language models include: Information Extraction, Question Answering, Summarization.

#### Misuse and Out-of-scope Use

*This section addresses what users ought not do with the model.*

See the  [LLM LICENSE ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10NMjEKjxR7mrZ5CvugGBVaF6nPEgNxFBIbkH7z5HB-0/edit), Attachment A, for detailed usage restrictions. The below list is non-exhaustive, but lists some easily foreseeable problematic use cases.

##### **Out-of-scope Uses**

-   Spam generation

-   Disinformation and influence operations

-   Disparagement and defamation

-   Harassment and abuse
  
-   Deception

-   Unconsented impersonation and imitation

-   Unconsented surveillance 


-   Generating content without attribution to the model, as specified in the [RAIL License, Use Restrictions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10NMjEKjxR7mrZ5CvugGBVaF6nPEgNxFBIbkH7z5HB-0/edit#heading=h.3blioxkgzsje).

## Risks and Limitations
*This section identifies foreseeable harms and misunderstandings.*

Model may:

-   Overrepresent some viewpoints and underrepresent others

-   Contain stereotypes
  
-   Contain personal information


-   Generate:

    -   Hateful, abusive, or violent language

    -   Discriminatory or prejudicial language

    -   Content that may not be appropriate for all settings, including sexual content.

-   Make errors, including producing incorrect information as if it were factual.

-   Generate irrelevant or repetitive outputs.
  
## Carbon Footprint

The training supercomputer, Jean Zay, uses mostly nuclear energy, and the heat generated by it is reused for heating campus housing. We are also tallying the overall carbon footprint of both training and upstream tasks, which we will report after training has been completed.

## Evaluation
  
### Factors
*The section lists the different kinds of variables that affect how this model behaves. These factors inform how the evaluation should be disaggregated in order to understand how the model works for different populations and in different contexts.*

## Evaluation Protocol

###### Describes the methods and techniques used to evaluate the model. Examples for these subsections available here.

#### Values-targeted

This evaluation is based on smaller, hand-crafted datasets that reflect different human values. Results highlight specific issues in the values embedded in a model.

#### Overview

We run three kinds of evaluation procedures. 

1.  Intrinsic: Evaluation during train time, calculated as the loss on the training datasets and perplexity per language.

2.  Zero-shot: Evaluation throughout development for architecture, scaling, and modeling information. All tests are in English.

3.  Downstream: Testing the fully trained model for different kinds of capabilities. This includes evaluation in multiple languages.

1.  Prompt-based

2.  Fine-tuned

Papers with further details include <https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rI7BL3fHIZq> (Zero-shot and Intrinsic) and _____

1.  ##### Intrinsic: Loss and Perplexity

_______

1.  ##### Zero Shot: Architecture, Scaling, and Modeling

We utilized the [Eleuther AI Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) (Gao et al., 2021), a framework for evaluating autoregressive language models across a variety of tasks and datasets, to compare and contrast different model approaches in English in a zero-shot setting (without fine-tuning for a specific task).

Code: 

<https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/bigscience/blob/master/evaluation/utilities/eai_lm_harness_through_training.slurm#L60>

1.  ##### Extrinsic: Downstream Tasks

Evaluation on multiple tasks, including bias testing.

Code:

[GitHub - bigscience-workshop/evaluation: Code and Data for Evaluation WG](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/evaluation)

### Evaluation Data

Only English tested. All evaluations use the trained model directly, without further fine-tuning.
